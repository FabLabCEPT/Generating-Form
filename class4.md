## Assignment

> Due: Next Class (14:30 IST - 2 September, 2014)

Create five (5) models.  Each should be created using one (1) or two (2) shape rules, and probably should involve some sort of labeling scheme.  There shold be one (1) base shape.  Each model should have *at least* 25 base shapes.

*Some things to think about:*
1. Should shapes be able to interpenitrate?
2. If there are multiple rules, should they be applied in a patterned way? (Can labeling help you preform this function? )
